"""The v0.8.0 warnings surface: the standing-condition banner and the
warnings/errors log.

Runs on the suite's parol6 fake-serial backend, whose buffer pre-dates the
v0.8.0 fields — which is half the contract under test: the status consumer
must leave the new sub-objects at their defaults instead of resetting them
each tick, so the wiring can be driven through the public
``commander.status`` surface exactly the way a capable backend's consumer
writes it. The full wire path runs against the real par6 runtime in
``test_par6_backend.py``.
