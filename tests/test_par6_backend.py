"""Waldo Commander driving the par6 backend against a live `par6d --sim`.

The rest of the suite runs on parol6. This one boots the app with
``WALDO_ROBOT=par6`` so the whole stack — backend discovery, robot start,
async client, status pipeline, UI — is exercised against the Rust runtime
over protocol v2, not a mock.

Must run in its own pytest process, so it is gated behind
``WALDO_PAR6_E2E=1`` and skipped in the ordinary suite:

    WALDO_PAR6_E2E=1 PAR6D_BIN=/path/to/par6d pytest tests/test_par6_backend.py

Backend choice, controller port and exclusive-start are process-global, and
NiceGUI's `user` fixture imports the app module once per session against the
parol6 controller the session fixtures start. Sharing a process with that
setup leaves par6d running but its STATUS frames never reaching the app's
consumer, so this asserts nothing useful there.

The opt-in is also the honesty boundary: without ``WALDO_PAR6_E2E`` the file
skips, so an ordinary checkout runs green — but once it is set, a missing
par6 backend or ``par6d`` binary is a failure, not a skip. CI sets the flag
precisely to run this test; letting it skip there would be a silent green.
