"""The key to the physics overlays.

A picture whose magnitudes are unstated lies. The achieved path is
coloured by tracking error and contact arrows are scaled by force, and
neither number is guessable from the scene — a millimetre of sag drawn
at its true size is invisible, and an arrow whose length means nothing
in particular reads as though it did. So the scale is written down.

Shown only while a record is on screen and something is drawn from it.
Nothing here exists on a backend that does not simulate.
